# Pokédex App ϞϞ(๑⚈ ․̫ ⚈๑)∩

## Prepare to catch them all!

Search for your favorite Pokémon to see a picture and stats. The app shows a list of Pokémon loaded from the Pokémon API : [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150). The list is populated using Javascript.

In this project, I learnt how to work with JavaScript. I then learnt how to combine JavaScript with HTML and CSS.
I also learnt how to use jQuery and Bootstrap.

This application shows a list of buttons. Each button has the name of a Pokemon. Once a button is clicked, a modal will appear with the details of that Pokemon.
